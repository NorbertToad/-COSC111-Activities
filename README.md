# -COSC111-Activities
Compilation of  COSC111 Activities


1.) Analog Signals - Is done with the use of 
a breadboard and led's, we made the led's turn on and off with
different intervals and different speeds.

2.) Photoresistor Simulation - Using the photoresistor,
we made a fire alarm of sorts, where if it detects a 
brightness of more than 220 value then the led lights up.

3.) Fire Sensor Simulation - Is the fire sensor we created
using a Photoresistor and a Temperature sensor, basically
like the Photoresistor simulation but we added a temp
sensor where the led will only go off if it reaches a 
certain temp and brightness.

4.) Midterms Laboratory - In our midterms lab, we used a 
Photoresistor wherin if it detects a certain amount of 
brightness, it will power on an LED ranging from lowest
to green, middle to yellow and highest brightness to red.

5.) Light Connection with FastAPI - In this activity,
we connected our board with an led to a different arduino 
with a button using the FastAPI. A connection made wirelessly,
wherein if you press a button on a different breadboard, the light
on our board will light up.

6.) Finals Laboratory - Using the same as FastAPI, we now then tried
to connect to the professors laptop with their wifi and with a button 
on our breadboard, tried to light up the LED's on our professors breadboard.
We used a code where if you pressed the button the LED would light up and 
if you let it go then the light would turn off.
